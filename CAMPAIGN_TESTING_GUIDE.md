SELECT id, name, status, audience_id 
FROM campaigns 
WHERE name = 'Test Campaign MVP';

-- Check recipients (should have 10)
SELECT COUNT(*), MIN(token), MAX(token)
FROM recipients 
WHERE audience_id = (
  SELECT audience_id FROM campaigns WHERE name = 'Test Campaign MVP'
);

-- Check condition
SELECT * FROM campaign_conditions 
WHERE campaign_id = (
  SELECT id FROM campaigns WHERE name = 'Test Campaign MVP'
);

-- Check reward config
SELECT * FROM campaign_reward_configs 
WHERE campaign_id = (
  SELECT id FROM campaigns WHERE name = 'Test Campaign MVP'
);
```

## Test 2: Condition Trigger & Gift Card Provisioning

### Method A: Via Call Center Interface

1. Go to: `/call-center`
2. Get a recipient token from database:

```sql
SELECT 
  r.token as redemption_code,
  r.first_name,
  r.last_name,
  r.phone,
  c.name as campaign_name
FROM recipients r
JOIN audiences a ON r.audience_id = a.id
JOIN campaigns c ON a.id = c.audience_id
WHERE c.name = 'Test Campaign MVP'
LIMIT 1;
```

3. Enter the redemption code in call center interface
4. Click "Provision Gift Card"
5. Select condition: `Call Completed`
6. Confirm provisioning

### Expected Results:

✅ Gift card provisioned message
✅ Card details displayed (code, number, PIN)
✅ SMS sent to recipient phone
✅ Gift card status changed to `claimed`
✅ Delivery record created

### Method B: Via Edge Function (Direct API)

Using Supabase Functions or browser console:

```javascript
// Get campaign and recipient IDs first
const { data: campaign } = await supabase
  .from('campaigns')
  .select('id, campaign_conditions(id)')
  .eq('name', 'Test Campaign MVP')
  .single();

const { data: recipient } = await supabase
  .from('recipients')
  .select('id')
  .eq('audience_id', campaign.audience_id)
  .limit(1)
  .single();

// Trigger condition evaluation
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('evaluate-conditions', {
  body: {
    recipientId: recipient.id,
    campaignId: campaign.id,
    eventType: 'call_completed',
    metadata: {
      trigger_source: 'manual_test'
    }
  }
});

console.log('Result:', data, error);
```

### Expected Results:

✅ Function returns success
✅ Gift card claimed from pool
✅ Delivery record created
✅ SMS sent (if Twilio configured)
✅ Condition status marked as `completed`

### Verification Queries:

```sql
-- Check gift card was claimed
SELECT 
  gc.card_code,
  gc.status,
  gc.claimed_at,
  gc.claimed_by_recipient_id
FROM gift_cards gc
WHERE gc.status = 'claimed'
ORDER BY gc.claimed_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Check delivery record
SELECT 
  gcd.*,
  r.first_name,
  r.last_name,
  r.phone
FROM gift_card_deliveries gcd
JOIN recipients r ON gcd.recipient_id = r.id
ORDER BY gcd.created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Check condition status
SELECT * FROM recipient_condition_status
WHERE recipient_id = '<RECIPIENT_ID>'
ORDER BY completed_at DESC;

-- Check trigger log
SELECT * FROM condition_triggers
WHERE recipient_id = '<RECIPIENT_ID>'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

---

## Test 3: SMS Delivery

### Prerequisites:

- Twilio credentials configured
- Recipient has valid phone number

### Test SMS via Twilio Test Mode:

```javascript
// Test Twilio SMS directly
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('send-gift-card-sms', {
  body: {
    deliveryId: '<DELIVERY_ID_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP>'
  }
});

console.log('SMS Result:', data, error);
```

### Expected Results:

✅ SMS sent successfully
✅ Twilio SID returned
✅ Delivery status updated to `sent`
✅ Recipient receives SMS with card details

### Twilio Console Verification:

1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/monitor/logs/messages
2. Find recent message
3. Check status: `delivered` or `sent`
4. View message body contains card code

---

## Test 4: PURL Landing Page

### Get PURL URL:

```sql
SELECT 
  c.id as campaign_id,
  r.token,
  r.first_name,
  r.last_name,
  CONCAT('http://localhost:8081/c/', c.id, '/', r.token) as purl_url
FROM recipients r
JOIN audiences a ON r.audience_id = a.id
JOIN campaigns c ON a.id = c.audience_id
WHERE c.name = 'Test Campaign MVP'
LIMIT 1;
```

### Visit PURL:

1. Copy the `purl_url` from query
2. Open in browser (or new incognito window)
3. Page should load with personalized content

### Expected Results:

✅ Page loads successfully
✅ Personalized greeting with recipient name
✅ Landing page content displays
✅ PURL visit tracked in database
✅ Forms (if present) are functional

### Verification Queries:

```sql
-- Check PURL visit was tracked
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE event_type = 'purl_visit'
AND recipient_id = '<RECIPIENT_ID>'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Or check tracking table if you have one
SELECT * FROM purl_visits
WHERE recipient_id = '<RECIPIENT_ID>'
ORDER BY visited_at DESC;
```

---

## Test 5: Gift Card Redemption Page

### Get Gift Card Reveal Link:

After a card is delivered, recipient can view it:

```sql
SELECT 
  CONCAT('http://localhost:8081/gift-card-reveal/', gcd.id) as reveal_url,
  gc.card_code,
  gc.card_value
FROM gift_card_deliveries gcd
JOIN gift_cards gc ON gcd.gift_card_id = gc.id
ORDER BY gcd.created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Visit Reveal Page:

1. Copy `reveal_url`
2. Open in browser
3. Card details should display

### Expected Results:

✅ Page loads successfully
✅ Card code visible
✅ Card value displayed

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Campaign creation fails

**Symptoms:** Error during wizard submission

**Solutions:**
1. Check user is assigned to client
2. Verify contact list has contacts
3. Check gift card pool has available cards
4. Review browser console for errors

### Issue: Gift card not provisioning

**Symptoms:** Condition triggers but no card claimed

**Solutions:**
1. Verify pool has `available_cards > 0`
2. Check gift cards have `status = 'available'`
3. Review edge function logs in Supabase
4. Check condition is properly configured

### Issue: SMS not sending

**Symptoms:** Card provisioned but no SMS received

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Twilio credentials in .env
2. Check recipient has valid phone number
3. Check Twilio console for error messages
4. Verify Twilio phone number is active
5. Check account balance in Twilio

### Issue: PURL page doesn't load

**Symptoms:** 404 or blank page

**Solutions:**
1. Verify campaign and recipient IDs are correct
2. Check token format (no spaces/special chars)
3. Review RLS policies on recipients table
4. Check landing_page_id is set (if using custom pages)

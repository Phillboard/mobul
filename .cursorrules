## KEY DOCUMENTS
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `PLATFORM_DICTIONARY.md` | **TERMINOLOGY BIBLE** - Use these terms |
| `LAUNCH_PRD.md` | Complete task instructions |
| `LAUNCH_PROGRESS.md` | Track progress here |
---
## TERMINOLOGY (From Dictionary)
**ALWAYS USE THESE TERMS:**
- **Agency** = Marketing agency using our platform
- **Client** = Business served by an Agency  
- **Customer** = Person who receives mail (also: recipient)
- **Agent** = Call center user
- **Unique Code** = Recipient's tracking code (preferred over customer_code)
- **Template Token** = `{{first_name}}`, `{{unique_code}}`, etc.
---
## STANDARD TEMPLATE TOKENS
```
{{first_name}}      - Recipient's first name
{{last_name}}       - Recipient's last name
{{full_name}}       - Recipient's full name
{{unique_code}}     - Recipient's unique tracking code
{{company_name}}    - Client's company name
{{purl}}            - Personal URL
{{qr_code}}         - QR code image
{{gift_card_amount}} - Gift card value
```
All designers MUST support these tokens consistently.
---
## CURRENT MISSION: 5-PHASE LAUNCH
1. **Phase 1**: Foundation & Terminology
2. **Phase 2**: OAuth Integration
3. **Phase 3**: AI-First Designer System (GrapesJS removed)
4. **Phase 4**: Code Review & Cleanup
5. **Phase 5**: Production Readiness
See `LAUNCH_PRD.md` for detailed tasks.
---
## TECH STACK
- React 18 + TypeScript 5.8 + Vite
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions + Auth)
- Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS
- TanStack Query + React Hook Form + Zod
- **NO GrapesJS** (removed, building AI-first designers)
---
## DESIGNER SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
New unified designer must support:
1. **Background upload** - Upload mail template as background
2. **Overlay design** - Place elements on top of background
3. **AI conversation** - Design through chat
4. **Drag-and-drop** - Manual element placement
5. **Template tokens** - All standard tokens above
6. **Export** - PDF (mail), HTML (landing/email)
All designers (mail, landing, email) use same framework.
---
## FIX IMMEDIATELY (No Permission)
- TypeScript errors
- Missing imports
- Linting errors
- `any` types
- Console.log in prod
- Duplicate code
- Missing error handling
- Terminology inconsistencies (per Dictionary)

## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.

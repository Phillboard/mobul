ACE Engage: Direct Mail Platform Overview
ACE Engage is a modern, all-in-one direct mail marketing platform that makes it easy to design, target, send, and track physical mail campaigns. In simple terms, ACE is like a “launchpad” for your direct mail initiatives – providing a control center where you can build campaigns, reach the right audience, automate mail-outs, and measure the results just as easily as you would with an online ad campaign. This overview will introduce what ACE does, its major features, and how you can use it from start to finish.
Why Direct Mail? Over 75% of marketers say direct mail delivers some of the best ROI, response, and conversion rates of any channel[1]. ACE Engage helps you tap into that potential by making physical mail as automated and measurable as digital marketing[2].
What Does ACE Engage Do?
In a nutshell, ACE Engage streamlines the entire direct mail process for businesses and marketers. It automates the heavy lifting – from creating a mail piece, to printing and postage, to tracking responses – so you can focus on strategy and content. With ACE, sending a personalized postcard campaign can be as simple as sending an email, with all the data and accountability you expect in the digital age.
Key benefits include:
* Ease of Use: No technical expertise required. A guided interface helps you create campaigns step by step.
* Automation: ACE handles printing, mailing, and even follow-ups automatically, saving you time and effort.
* Personalization: Easily tailor each mailer with personal details or unique content for the recipient, boosting engagement (personalized mail can increase response rates by 30-50%[3]).
* Accountability: Every mail piece is trackable. You’ll know when it’s delivered and if the recipient responds – bringing full transparency and ROI tracking to direct mail.
* Integration: Optionally connect your campaigns with digital channels and CRM systems for a seamless marketing mix (e.g. trigger a postcard after an online interaction, or sync responses back to your sales database).
Now, let’s explore ACE Engage’s major features and how they add value.
Campaign Building Made Easy
Designing and launching a direct mail campaign is simple with ACE’s campaign builder. The platform provides a multi-step wizard that guides you through creating a campaign from start to finish[4]. This is your campaign launchpad, where you can:
* Choose a Template or Design: Start from a library of postcard and letter templates, or upload your own design. ACE even offers an AI-assisted template builder to help generate eye-catching designs[5], so you don’t need to be a designer. You can customize text, images, and colors through a user-friendly editor.
* Personalize Your Mailers: Insert merge fields (like name, city, product of interest) to personalize each mail piece. ACE supports variable data and dynamic content, so recipients get mail that feels one-on-one. For example, you might include a personalized map to the nearest store or a unique promo code for each person.
* Set Campaign Details: Give your campaign a name, select the format (postcard, letter, etc.), and schedule a send date. You can send immediately or plan mail drops in advance – ACE will automate the schedule.
* Collaborate and Approve: If you work in a team, ACE includes campaign approvals and feedback loops[6]. This means you can share a preview of the mailer with colleagues or clients, gather comments, and require a sign-off before anything is sent. It’s a built-in quality check to ensure everyone is on the same page.
Why it’s valuable: The campaign builder turns what used to be a complex, multi-step process into a few clicks[7]. You don’t have to juggle multiple tools or emails with a print vendor – ACE provides an intuitive “fill-in-the-blanks” workflow. In minutes, you can go from an idea to a ready-to-send direct mail campaign, complete with professional design and personalization.
Intelligent Audience Targeting
Sending mail to the right people is crucial. ACE Engage makes audience selection intelligent and seamless:
* Upload or Integrate Your Lists: You can import your existing mailing list (e.g. a CSV of customer addresses) directly into ACE[8]. The platform will handle deduping and address verification to ensure accuracy. ACE also integrates with popular CRM or e-commerce systems, so you can sync contacts without manual work.
* Purchase Targeted Leads: Don’t have a list? ACE has a built-in lead marketplace with geo-targeting[9]. Think of it as an address search engine: you can filter and find new prospects by demographics, location, or interests. For example, you might target homeowners within a certain ZIP code or businesses of a certain size in your area. The platform will suggest and source high-quality mailing contacts that fit your criteria.
* Segment and Filter Audiences: Whether you use your own data or acquired leads, ACE lets you segment your audience for precision. You can create groups based on purchase history, customer lifecycle (e.g. new vs. lapsed customers), or any attributes you have. This way, each campaign can be tailored to a specific audience segment, improving relevance and response rates[10].
* Smart Targeting Suggestions: ACE’s intelligent targeting might also provide suggestions – for instance, identifying lookalike audiences or high-response segments from past campaign data. It’s like having a marketing analyst inside the tool, helping you optimize who should get your mail.
Why it’s valuable: Effective direct mail is all about sending the right message to the right people[11]. ACE’s audience tools ensure you’re not guessing. By leveraging data (yours or ACE’s), you can focus your budget on the recipients most likely to respond. This means higher ROI and less waste on mailers that don’t convert. Plus, the convenience of an integrated mailing list marketplace saves you from dealing with external list brokers – it’s all in one platform.
Automated Printing & Mail Fulfillment
One of ACE Engage’s biggest advantages is that it handles the printing and mailing logistics for you, automatically. Once you’ve set up your campaign and audience, you can hit launch and let ACE do the rest:
* Print Production: ACE connects with a network of professional print facilities to produce your mail pieces on demand. You don’t need to coordinate with printers or worry about print files and formats. The platform ensures your postcards or letters are printed at high quality, using the selected template and personalization for each recipient.
* Mailing & Postage: ACE takes care of all the mail fulfillment – stamping, sorting, and handing off to the postal service. You can choose classes of mail (e.g. First Class for speed or Standard Mail for cost savings), and ACE will optimize the process. For example, it might route jobs to a print center closest to your audience to reduce delivery time[12]. You’ll see postage costs upfront during campaign setup, so there are no surprises.
* Timing and Triggers: Automation means you can schedule campaigns or even set up triggered mail. For instance, you could configure the platform to send a welcome postcard whenever a new customer signs up, or a follow-up mailer if someone hasn’t purchased in 6 months – all without you manually initiating each send. ACE works in the background like a reliable autopilot, launching mail based on your defined events or schedule.
* Scale and Speed: Whether you’re sending one piece or one million, ACE scales to your needs. Automation eliminates the long lead times of traditional direct mail; campaigns that once took weeks can go out in days[7]. The platform also handles batch sizes of any size efficiently, allowing for quick small tests or large nationwide blasts as needed.
Why it’s valuable: No more bottlenecks or manual mailing chores. ACE’s automated fulfillment brings efficiency and peace of mind. You can trust that every piece will be produced correctly and mailed on time, because the process is systematized. This frees you up – instead of dealing with printers and mailing houses, you can spend time on strategy and creative. Plus, ACE’s use of automation and a print network can reduce errors and delays, ensuring reliable delivery for your campaign (you’ll even get delivery tracking – more on that next).
Conversion Tracking
Traditional mail might be physical, but ACE Engage makes it digital-friendly by tracking conversions and responses from your direct mail. The platform equips your mailers with tools to know exactly who engages with your campaign and how:
* Personalized URLs (PURLs): Each recipient can get a unique web address (URL) printed on their mail piece, leading to a landing page just for them. When they visit, ACE records that visit and ties it back to the individual and campaign[13][5]. This way, you know John Doe actually went online after getting your postcard. It’s a seamless bridge from physical mail to digital action.
* QR Codes: ACE can automatically generate and print unique QR codes on your postcards or letters. When scanned with a smartphone, these QR codes take the recipient to your chosen page (or any online experience) and simultaneously log the scan event. QR codes provide a frictionless way for recipients to respond, and ACE tracks every scan in real time.
* Custom Promo Codes or Tracking Numbers: If your campaign uses coupon codes or dedicated phone numbers, ACE can help assign unique codes per recipient or per mailing. For example, a postcard might say “Use code ACE123 for 10% off.” When that code is redeemed, you’ll know it came from the direct mail. Similarly, you could use unique tracked phone numbers (via integration) so if a customer calls, it registers as a conversion from that mailer.
* Response Forms and Reply Mechanisms: ACE also supports things like integrated reply cards or URLs where recipients can fill out a form (e.g. to RSVP for an event or request more info). Any responses through those channels are captured. In some cases, mailers can include a business reply mail or similar, but ACE’s focus is on digital tracking to get instant feedback when possible.
Why it’s valuable: This feature brings accountability to direct mail – you’re no longer left wondering who responded or if the campaign worked. Every action the recipient takes in response to the mail is logged. Nearly half of marketers rely on tactics like QR codes and PURLs to measure direct mail conversions[14], and ACE has these built in. The result: you can quantitatively track the ROI of a mail campaign, just like you would with clicks on an email or ad. It turns mail into a truly data-driven channel.
Attribution and Analytics
All the data collected from delivery and responses feeds into ACE Engage’s analytics dashboard, which is your direct mail mission control for performance insights. The platform provides robust reporting and attribution features:
* Real-Time Dashboard: As soon as your campaign is launched, you can monitor its progress. ACE shows you metrics like how many pieces have been printed and mailed, how many are confirmed delivered, and response metrics as they come in. The event tracking built into ACE (e.g. QR scans, website visits) populates the dashboard with real-time conversion counts[9].
* Conversion Attribution: ACE ties conversions directly back to the campaign (and even down to the individual recipient). If Jane Doe from your mailing list makes a purchase on your website after scanning her postcard’s QR code, the platform will attribute that sale to the campaign. This gives you a clear line of sight from mailer to revenue – critical for calculating campaign ROI and justifying your spend.
* Campaign Performance Metrics: The analytics include all the key performance indicators for direct mail. You’ll see response rates (what percentage of recipients responded in some way), conversion rates (what percentage took the desired action, like purchase or sign-up), and even engagement by segment if you used different audience groups or A/B tests. ACE can display results in aggregate and also let you drill down by mail drop, geography, audience demographic, etc. For example, you might discover that Segment A responded at 3% while Segment B at 5%, guiding you to refine targeting next time.
* ROI and Cost Analysis: Because ACE knows your campaign costs (printing, postage, incentives) and tracks the conversions, it can calculate return on investment automatically. The dashboard might show you metrics such as cost per response and revenue generated, so you have an “at-a-glance” view of how the campaign is performing financially. This accountability in numbers means no more guesswork – you can confidently report outcomes to your team or clients with backing data.
* Exportable Reports and Integrations: Need to share results or dig deeper? ACE lets you export detailed reports (e.g. to CSV or PDF) and also offers integration hooks (like webhooks or APIs) to send the data to your other tools. For instance, you could pipe conversion events into your Google Analytics or CRM system to include in broader marketing analysis. ACE basically ensures direct mail isn’t a silo – its analytics can plug into your overall marketing measurement.
Why it’s valuable: The analytics and attribution piece closes the loop on your campaign. Direct mail is no longer a blind investment; ACE provides concrete evidence of outcomes. Marketers can hold campaigns accountable and optimize based on what the data shows. This level of insight was once difficult in offline marketing, but ACE brings it to your fingertips, building confidence in direct mail as a measurable channel.
Incentive Delivery (Rewards & Gift Cards)
ACE Engage goes a step further by incorporating incentive management into your campaigns. Sometimes, offering a reward can dramatically boost response rates – for example, “Get a $5 gift card when you take a demo” or “Scratch off this postcard to see your prize.” With ACE, you can handle these incentives smoothly:
* Digital Gift Cards Integration: The platform allows you to send gift cards or reward codes automatically as part of a campaign. You might configure a campaign so that when a recipient completes a desired action (like filling out a form or calling a number), they are instantly sent a digital gift card (e.g. a Visa prepaid code, Amazon gift card, etc.). ACE can deliver these via email or SMS, and it keeps track of who received which reward and when.
* In-House Reward Pools: ACE provides tools to upload or manage a pool of reward codes (gift card codes, promo codes, etc.) for your campaign[15][16]. For example, you can bulk-import 100 gift card codes you bought, and ACE will hold them securely. As responses come in, the system will claim and send out codes one by one – ensuring no duplicate use and maintaining an audit trail[17][18]. This means you have full control over the incentives inventory and costs.
* Trigger-Based Rewards: You can set conditions for when a reward is given. Maybe Condition 1 is “lead books an appointment, send $5 gift card” and Condition 2 is “lead makes a purchase, send $20 gift card.” ACE’s campaign setup lets you define these rules (no coding needed), so incentives are automatically tied to specific conversion events[19][20]. The moment a qualifying event is logged (e.g. the appointment is confirmed in your system), ACE triggers the reward delivery – no manual fulfillment required.
* Tracking and Accountability: Just like the rest of the campaign, ACE tracks incentive fulfillment. You can see how many rewards have been sent, who received them, and if any are left in your pool[21][22]. There’s even reporting for incentive costs, so they factor into your campaign ROI calculations. This transparency ensures that your incentive program is fully accountable and prevent misuse (each reward is logged to a specific recipient and action).
Why it’s valuable: Incentives can significantly increase engagement, but managing them can be a headache if done separately. ACE builds it into your direct mail workflow. By automating reward delivery, it boosts response rates (people love getting something in return) while removing the manual work of sending gift cards or promo codes to each responder. Moreover, ACE’s approach (managing a pool of pre-purchased cards) can save money by letting you buy in bulk at a discount and avoid third-party fees[15]. Overall, this feature helps turn more recipients into active responders and ultimately customers, making your campaigns more effective.
How Users Interact with ACE: A Step-by-Step Journey
To tie it all together, let’s walk through a simplified user journey on the ACE Engage platform – from setting up a campaign to seeing the results:
1. Start a New Campaign: After logging in to ACE, you click “Create Campaign”. This opens the campaign wizard (your launchpad). You enter basic details: campaign name, choose a mail format (e.g. 6x9 postcard), and pick a goal (e.g. Customer Reactivation or Event Invitation for internal tracking).
2. Design Your Mailer: Next, you’re guided to design the mail piece. You can select a template from the gallery or create your own. Using ACE’s drag-and-drop editor, you add your logo, write a headline and message, and perhaps include a call-to-action like a QR code or PURL that ACE generates on the spot. You insert personalization tags (e.g. first name) so each postcard prints with a personal touch. A preview shows you exactly what recipients will get.
3. Target Your Audience: In the following step, you define who will receive the mailer. You might upload a CSV of contacts or choose a saved segment from your database. If you need new leads, you click “Find Audience” and use the built-in search to filter prospects (for example, “50k+ income households within 10 miles of ZIP 12345”). ACE shows an estimate of how many addresses match and the cost. With one click, you add those to your campaign. You can also remove any contacts or add more filters until you’re happy with the list.
4. Configure Options & Incentives: Still in the wizard, you set the mailing specifics. You choose when to send (immediately or schedule a future date). Select postage class (First Class for speed or Standard for economy). If you want to include an incentive, you toggle on a “Reward” option and fill in details – e.g. select a $5 Starbucks gift card to send upon form submission. ACE may ask you to upload the gift card codes (or integrate with a provider) at this point, which it then validates and stores securely. You also set up any tracking you want – for example, link your campaign to a specific landing page URL that you’ve created for it (or let ACE generate one).
5. Review and Launch: The final step in the setup is a summary page. Here, ACE shows you a checklist: your design, your audience count, postage cost, any personalization or reward rules, and the expected send date. If you have teammates, this is where the approval workflow can happen – you might click “Request Approval” to have a manager review the summary. Once everything looks good, you hit “Launch Campaign”. ACE confirms that the campaign is scheduled or sent, and you’re all set. 🎉
6. Automated Fulfillment in Action: After launch, ACE takes over behind the scenes. It sends the print orders to the best suited print facilities and ensures every mail piece is produced correctly. You can actually watch the status in real time – for example, the dashboard might show “Printing 1,000 pieces” and then “Mailed: Handed off to USPS on Nov 30”. If you scheduled the campaign, ACE will queue it and mail at the right time. You don’t need to intervene at all.
7. Tracking Responses and Conversions: Once the mail is delivered (ACE will even display delivery confirmations as they come in), the platform starts logging any interactions: - You see dashboard alerts or updates like “50 QR scans so far” or “120 website visits from PURLs”. - If you offered a gift card incentive, ACE shows how many have been claimed and automatically sends out those rewards via email/SMS. For instance, “Sent 10/100 gift cards – 90 remaining in pool”. - All these events appear on your campaign timeline in ACE.
8. Analyze Results: As the campaign runs its course (or after a set period), you dive into the Analytics Dashboard for a full report. You view the campaign performance metrics: perhaps a 3.2% response rate, conversion count, and a breakdown by segments you had. You notice, for example, that the younger demographic scanned the QR code more, while older recipients favored typing the URL – insights that help tailor future campaigns. You also check the ROI: ACE shows that for $500 spent, the campaign generated $5,000 in sales attributed, a 10x return. The gift card costs are accounted for in the spend. Satisfied with the results, you export a summary PDF to share with your team.
9. Iterate and Refine: Using the insights from ACE, you can easily refine your next campaign. Maybe you decide to do a follow-up mailing to those who didn’t respond (ACE can create a new campaign targeting just the non-responders – a retargeting mailer). Or you might A/B test two different postcard designs next time to see which performs better. ACE enables a cycle of continuous improvement: build, launch, measure, and improve, all within one platform.
Throughout this journey, ACE Engage also provides helpful guidance. The interface has tooltips and even a friendly chatbot (the built-in **“Dr. Phillip” AI assistant) that can answer questions as you go, like “How do I import an audience?” or “What’s the difference between a PURL and a QR code?”[23]. In short, you’re never lost – the platform feels like a modern, user-friendly SaaS application with a warm tone that makes a traditionally complex task feel approachable.

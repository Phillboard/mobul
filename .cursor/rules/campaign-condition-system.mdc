Campaign Condition Management System
Importance Score: 90

Core Components:

1. Condition Trigger Engine
Path: src/components/campaigns/ConditionTriggerManager.tsx
- Multi-stage condition evaluation pipeline
- Sequential dependency tracking between conditions
- Dynamic reward allocation based on completion state
- Automated trigger validation for reward distribution

2. Campaign Reward Pool Management 
Path: src/features/campaigns/RewardPoolController.ts
- Gift card inventory allocation per condition
- Pool health monitoring with utilization thresholds
- Automated replenishment triggers
- Balance tracking across multiple reward types

3. Condition Templates
Path: src/lib/condition-templates.ts
- Pre-defined condition chains for common scenarios:
  - Call Center: Call Duration + Verification
  - Direct Mail: Delivery + Response
  - Digital: Form Submit + Email Verify
- Custom template builder with dependency checks

4. Reward Distribution Rules
Path: src/features/rewards/DistributionManager.ts
- Time-window based reward release
- Multi-channel delivery options (SMS, Email, Physical)
- Fallback delivery mechanisms
- Anti-fraud verification steps

5. Campaign Progress Tracking
Path: src/components/campaigns/ProgressTracker.tsx
- Real-time condition completion monitoring
- Participant status tracking across conditions
- Automated condition unlocking based on prerequisites
- Campaign-level completion analytics

6. Trigger Event Processing
Path: src/lib/trigger-processor.ts
- Event normalization from multiple sources
- Condition matching and validation
- Sequential trigger enforcement
- Cross-condition dependency validation

The system implements a sophisticated multi-stage campaign management system where rewards and actions are triggered based on completion of sequential conditions with complex dependencies.

Campaign Condition Core Components:

1. Trigger Evaluation Engine (85/100)
- Sequential condition evaluation pipeline
- Multi-stage verification gates
- Dependency graph for nested conditions
- Status progression tracking (pending → active → completed)
- Rollback handling for failed conditions

2. Reward Distribution System (90/100)
- Pool-based reward allocation
- Inventory verification before trigger
- Delivery method selection (SMS/email)
- Multi-attempt delivery with fallbacks
- Campaign-specific distribution rules

3. Campaign Status Management (80/100)
- Lifecycle state machine:
  - draft → pending → active → completed
  - Parallel condition tracking
  - Aggregate completion calculation
  - Real-time status updates

4. Validation Framework (75/100)
- Pre-launch validation suite
- Resource availability checks
- Recipient verification
- Pool allocation confirmation
- Delivery method validation

Core Workflows:

1. Condition Processing:
```
Trigger Event → Validation → Dependency Check → Execution → Reward Distribution
```

2. Reward Fulfillment:
```
Pool Selection → Availability Check → Allocation → Delivery → Confirmation
```

Key Data Models:

1. Campaign Condition
- Type: trigger_type
- Dependencies: [condition_ids]
- Completion_rules: {rule_set}
- Reward_config: {reward_settings}

2. Condition Trigger
- Source: trigger_source
- Rules: {validation_rules}
- Actions: [sequential_steps]
- Fallbacks: {fallback_config}

3. Reward Pool
- Type: reward_type
- Allocation: {distribution_rules}
- Inventory: current_count
- Thresholds: {min_levels}

# permission-inheritance

Permission Hierarchy System:
- Organization-level permissions cascade down to child organizations
- Parent organization owners automatically inherit admin access to child orgs
- Agency owners receive full access across all client organizations
- Client owners restricted to their specific organization scope

Role-Based Permission Structure:
1. Root System Roles:
- SUPER_ADMIN (100) - Complete platform access
- AGENCY_OWNER (90) - Cross-organization management
- CLIENT_OWNER (80) - Single organization scope
- MANAGER (70) - Department level access
- AGENT (60) - Limited operational access

2. Permission Categories:
- campaigns.manage - Campaign creation and editing
- campaigns.approve - Multi-step approval workflow
- contacts.manage - Contact list management
- giftcards.admin - Gift card pool administration
- reports.view - Analytics access

3. Inheritance Rules:
- Higher roles automatically inherit permissions from lower roles
- Department managers inherit team member permissions
- Client owners inherit all org-specific permissions
- Agency owners inherit permissions across client organizations

4. Special Cases:
- Tech support role receives temporary elevated access
- Auditor role gets read-only access across organizations
- Call center supervisors inherit agent permissions plus approval rights

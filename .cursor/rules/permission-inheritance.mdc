# permission-inheritance

Hierarchical Permission Model:
- Three-tier organization structure: Agency -> Company -> User
- Permissions inherit downward through organizational hierarchy
- Child organizations can restrict but not expand inherited permissions

Role-Based Access Control:
- Primary roles with default permission sets:
  - agency_owner: Full access across all child organizations
  - company_owner: Full access within assigned company
  - campaign_manager: Campaign creation and management 
  - call_center_agent: Redemption and contact management
  - tech_support: System configuration and troubleshooting

Permission Categories:
1. Campaign Management (Importance: 85)
- View/edit/delete campaigns
- Approve campaign launches
- Manage recipient lists
- Control reward distribution

2. Gift Card Operations (Importance: 90)
- Pool management permissions
- Redemption authorization levels
- Inventory control access
- Provider configuration rights

3. Organization Administration (Importance: 80)
- User management scope
- Client organization control
- Role assignment capabilities
- Billing access levels

Permission Inheritance Rules:
- Parent organizations can override child permissions
- Role permissions stack with direct grants
- Most permissive access level takes precedence
- Category-based permission grouping
- Automatic role requirement validation

Multi-Tenant Isolation:
- Cross-organization data access controls
- Client-specific permission boundaries
- Resource sharing restrictions
- Agency-level permission templates

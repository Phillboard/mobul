# permission-inheritance

The hierarchical permission system implements multi-level inheritance across:

TENANT HIERARCHY:
- Agency (Top Level)
- Organization (Mid Level) 
- Client (Bottom Level)

Each level inherits permissions downward with override capabilities:
- Agency permissions cascade to organizations
- Organization permissions cascade to clients
- Client-level can override inherited permissions

ROLE CATEGORIES:
1. Administrative Roles (85/100)
- agency_owner: Full system access
- organization_owner: Organization-scoped access
- client_owner: Client-scoped access

2. Operational Roles (75/100)
- campaign_manager: Campaign creation/editing
- call_center_agent: Call handling/verification
- content_creator: Form/template management

PERMISSION INHERITANCE RULES:
1. Explicit Overrides
- Lower levels can explicitly override inherited permissions
- Overrides must be explicitly tracked in permission_overrides table
- Override history maintained for audit purposes

2. Category-Based Grouping
- Permissions grouped by functional area:
  - campaigns
  - gift_cards
  - contacts
  - reporting
- Categories inherit as complete units

3. Role-Permission Mapping
- Roles mapped to permission sets
- Permission sets inherit based on role hierarchy
- Cross-tenant permission resolution

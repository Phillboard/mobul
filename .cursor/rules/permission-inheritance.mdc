# permission-inheritance

Permission Inheritance System:

1. Hierarchical Role Structure
- 6 core permission levels with inheritance:
  - Level 1: Admin (full system access)
  - Level 2: Tech Support (cross-organization support)
  - Level 3: Agency Owner (multi-client management)
  - Level 4: Company Owner (single organization)
  - Level 5: Developer (API/integration access)
  - Level 6: Call Center (limited campaign access)

2. Multi-tenant Permission Model
- Organization-level permissions cascade down to users
- Agency permissions extend across client organizations
- Client-specific permission overrides at organization level
- Permission categories with granular access control:
  - Campaign Management
  - Gift Card Administration 
  - Contact Management
  - Analytics Access
  - User Management
  - API Access

3. Permission Override System
- Higher roles can override lower role permissions
- Organization-specific permission customization
- Role-based permission templates
- Custom permission sets per organization type
- Category-based permission grouping

4. Client Permission Isolation
- Strict tenant isolation between organizations
- Agency-level cross-client access controls
- Client-specific feature enablement flags
- Organization type determines base permissions

The system implements a sophisticated permission model combining role hierarchy, tenant isolation, and granular access controls tailored for marketing campaign management and gift card administration.

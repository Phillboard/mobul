# Marketing Automation Engine

## Automation Builder Architecture

### Core Automation Design

```typescript
interface AutomationStep {
  id: string;
  type: 'trigger' | 'condition' | 'action';
  configuration: Record<string, any>;
}

interface MarketingAutomation {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  steps: AutomationStep[];
  status: 'draft' | 'active' | 'paused';
}

const useMarketingAutomations = () => {
  const buildAutomationWorkflow = (steps: AutomationStep[]) => {
    // Complex workflow compilation
    return compileAutomationLogic(steps);
  };

  return { buildAutomationWorkflow };
};
```

### Campaign Validation

- Comprehensive step validation
- Conditional logic verification
- Performance-optimized rule checking

### Trigger and Condition Management

```typescript
const TriggerSelector: React.FC = () => {
  const availableTriggers = [
    'user_signup',
    'purchase_completed',
    'email_opened',
    // Dynamic trigger registration
  ];

  return <SelectComponent options={availableTriggers} />;
};
```

## Advanced Capabilities

- Dynamic automation builder
- Multi-step workflow creation
- Intelligent condition evaluation
- Real-time marketing process orchestration

## Design Principles

- Modular step-based architecture
- Flexible trigger mechanisms
- Runtime condition compilation
- Low-overhead automation execution

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy-evaluated conditions
- Minimal runtime overhead
- Efficient workflow compilation
- Scalable automation management

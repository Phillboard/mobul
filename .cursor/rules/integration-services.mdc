# Integration Services Ecosystem

## Third-Party Integration Architecture

### Core Integration Design

```typescript
interface IntegrationClient {
  connect(): Promise<boolean>;
  authenticate(credentials: Record<string, string>): Promise<void>;
  executeAction(action: string, payload: any): Promise<any>;
}

class TilloIntegration implements IntegrationClient {
  async connect() { /* Secure connection logic */ }
  async authenticate(credentials) { /* Robust authentication */ }
  async executeAction(action, payload) { /* Dynamic action execution */ }
}

class ZapierIntegration implements IntegrationClient {
  // Similar implementation with Zapier-specific workflows
}
```

### Supabase Client Configuration

```typescript
const supabaseClient = createClient({
  supabaseUrl: process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  supabaseKey: process.env.SUPABASE_KEY,
  options: {
    auth: { persistSession: true },
    realtime: { params: { eventsPerSecond: 10 } }
  }
});
```

### Integration Workflow

1. Credential Management
2. Secure Authentication
3. Dynamic Action Execution
4. Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms

## Advanced Features

- Pluggable integration architecture
- Dynamic service connection
- Comprehensive error management
- Flexible credential handling

## Security Principles

- Secure credential storage
- Encrypted communication channels
- Granular permission management
- Minimal exposure of sensitive information

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy service initialization
- Efficient connection pooling
- Minimal overhead integrations
- Intelligent caching mechanisms

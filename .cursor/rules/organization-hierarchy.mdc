# organization-hierarchy

Core organization model implementing a multi-tier hierarchy:

PLATFORM
|-- ORGANIZATION 
    |-- AGENCY
        |-- CLIENT
            |-- CAMPAIGN

Organization Management System (Importance: 95/100)
- Hierarchical credit distribution from platform -> org -> agency -> client levels 
- Inherited settings/permissions flow down hierarchy with override capabilities
- Each level has independent gift card pools and credit accounts
- Organizations can manage multiple agencies, each with multiple clients

Permissions & Role System (Importance: 90/100)
- Role-based access control with granular permissions:
  - platform_admin
  - organization_admin 
  - agency_owner
  - client_owner
  - call_center_agent
  - api_integration
- Permissions inherit down hierarchy but can be restricted at each level
- Dual permission model: role-based + direct grants

Client-Agency Model (Importance: 85/100)
- Agencies can manage multiple clients
- Clients belong to single agency
- Shared resource pools between agency and clients
- Client-specific overrides for inherited settings

Business Rules:
- Credits flow one-way down hierarchy (platform -> org -> agency -> client)
- Settings inherit down with override capability at each level
- Organizations maintain isolation between agencies
- Agencies share resources with their clients
- Each level tracks its own gift card pools and credit balances

Key Implementation Files:
- src/types/organizations.ts - Core organization data model
- src/hooks/useOrganization.ts - Organization management logic
- src/contexts/OrganizationContext.tsx - Hierarchy state management

- Credit reservation system for pending campaigns

3. Client-Agency Relationship Logic (Importance: 85)
- One-to-many agency-client relationships
- Configurable client access levels
- Shared resource management between agencies
- Client-specific pricing overrides

4. Gift Card Pool Inheritance (Importance: 80)

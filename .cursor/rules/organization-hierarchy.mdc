# organization-hierarchy

Multi-Tenant Data Model (Importance: 95/100)

Hierarchical Organization Structure:
- Platform → Agency → Client → Campaign model
- Organizations can operate as both agencies and direct clients
- Strict one-way relationship flow (child entities cannot have multiple parents)
- Organization status changes cascade to child entities

Role-Based Permissions:
- Platform Admin: Full system access
- Agency Owner: Gift card marketplace, pool management
- Client Owner: Campaign creation, contact management 
- Call Center: Redemption verification
- Support: Time-limited impersonation capabilities

Client-Agency Relationships:
- Agencies can manage multiple client organizations
- Each client tied to single agency for billing/credits
- Credits flow downward through hierarchy
- Custom pricing inherits through organizational chain

Key Access Controls:
- Campaign visibility scoped to owning organization
- Contact lists isolated between clients
- Analytics roll up through organization chain
- Template sharing controlled by parent organization

Permission Inheritance:
- Settings cascade from agency to client level
- Mail provider configurations inherit downward
- Brand access controlled at agency level
- Credit allocations flow through hierarchy

Organization Types:
- Direct Client: Standalone organization
- Agency: Manages multiple client organizations  
- Platform Admin: System-level organization
- Hybrid: Both agency and direct client capabilities

This organizational model supports complex business relationships while maintaining strict data isolation and hierarchical control flows.

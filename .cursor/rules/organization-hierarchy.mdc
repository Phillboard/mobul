# organization-hierarchy

Organization Structure Components:

1. Multi-Tenant Hierarchy (src/components/settings/PermissionCategoryManager.tsx)
Importance Score: 90
- Three-tier organization model:
  - Agency (top level)
  - Company (mid level) 
  - Client (bottom level)
- Organizations can exist at any single tier
- Clients can belong to multiple companies
- Companies can belong to multiple agencies

2. Permission Inheritance System (src/lib/auth/roleRequirements.ts)
Importance Score: 85
- Hierarchical permission flow:
  - Permissions cascade down organization levels
  - Child organizations inherit parent permissions
  - Organization-specific permission overrides
- Role-based access tied to organization level:
  - agency_owner: Full agency-level access
  - company_owner: Company + client access
  - client_user: Single client access

3. Client-Agency Relationships (src/components/settings/ClientBrandingEditor.tsx)
Importance Score: 80
- Managed service provider model
- Agencies can manage multiple client organizations
- Clients maintain independent branding/settings
- Resource sharing between agency-client pairs
- Credit allocation flows from agency to client

4. Organization Settings Inheritance (src/contexts/TenantContext.tsx)
Importance Score: 75
- Configurable inheritance rules for:
  - Brand settings
  - Gift card pools
  - Campaign templates
  - User roles
- Override system for client-specific configurations

5. Cross-Organization Operations (src/components/settings/ZapierIntegrationTab.tsx)
Importance Score: 70
- Integration configuration inheritance
- Shared resource pools across organization levels
- Agency-level analytics aggregation
- Multi-client campaign management

Core Business Rules:
- Organizations can only exist at one hierarchy level
- Permissions flow downward only
- Resources can be shared across organization levels
- Client settings override agency defaults
- Credit allocation follows organizational hierarchy

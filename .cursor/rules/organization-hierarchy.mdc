# organization-hierarchy

Multi-Tenant Hierarchy Model
Importance Score: 95

1. Organization Structure
- Three-tier hierarchy: Platform -> Agency -> Client
- Asymmetric parent-child relationships with inheritance
- Agencies can manage multiple clients but clients belong to one agency
- Platform admins have cross-organization visibility

2. Credit Management Hierarchy
- Unidirectional credit flow from platform down to clients
- Agency-level credit pools with allocation controls
- Client-specific credit limits and usage tracking
- Campaign-level budget reservations
- Automatic rollup reporting to parent organizations

3. Role-Based Access Control
- Role inheritance follows organizational hierarchy
- Specialized roles:
  * Platform Admin: Cross-organization access
  * Agency Owner: Agency + child client access
  * Client Admin: Single client access
  * Campaign Manager: Campaign-specific access
- Permission inheritance with override capability at child levels

4. Client-Agency Relationships  
- Agencies can provision and manage multiple clients
- Client configuration inheritance from parent agency
- Template sharing between agency and client levels
- Custom billing rates per client relationship
- Shared resource pools with allocation controls

5. Resource Management
- Gift card pool allocation across hierarchy
- Template sharing with inheritance
- Audience list segregation by organization
- Campaign asset management with parent visibility

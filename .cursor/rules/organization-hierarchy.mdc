# organization-hierarchy

Multi-Tenant Organizational Model:

1. Hierarchical Structure (90/100)
- Platform (Top Level)
- Agency Organizations (Mid Level) 
- Client Organizations (Base Level)
- Strict unidirectional inheritance flow
- Support for organization-specific branding/settings

2. Permission System (85/100)
- Role-based access control aligned with org hierarchy
- Permission inheritance from parent to child orgs
- Override capabilities at each level
- Granular feature access controls per organization type

3. Credit Management (90/100)
- Hierarchical credit allocation system
- Credits flow downward through organization levels
- Budget tracking and threshold monitoring
- Pool-based credit management for campaigns

4. Resource Sharing Rules (80/100)
- Template inheritance across organization levels
- Brand asset sharing controls
- Campaign resource allocation rules
- Gift card pool access management

Core Business Rules:
- Organizations can only access resources at/below their level
- Child organizations inherit parent permissions by default
- Credit allocation requires sufficient parent balance
- Resource sharing follows strict hierarchical paths

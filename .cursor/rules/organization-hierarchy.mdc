# organization-hierarchy

Multi-Tenant Organization Model
Importance Score: 90

Core Hierarchy:
- Platform Level
  - ACE Engage (platform owner)
  - System-wide configuration
  - Cross-organization reporting

- Agency Level 
  - Independent marketing agencies
  - Multiple client management
  - Resource allocation control
  - Credit pool management
  - Template library access

- Client Level
  - End customer organizations
  - Campaign execution
  - Limited resource access
  - Inherited templates

Permission Inheritance Rules:
- Agency owners can access all client data
- Client owners restricted to own organization
- Role permissions cascade down hierarchy
- Resource access follows organization tree

Credit Flow System:
- Unidirectional credit movement (Platform → Agency → Client)
- Pool-based credit allocation
- Agency-level budgeting controls
- Client spending limits

Client-Agency Relationships:
- Many-to-many client-agency mappings
- Primary agency designation
- Inherited billing relationships
- Shared resource access rules

Data Isolation:
- Strict tenant boundaries
- Cross-organization data protection
- Role-based visibility filters
- Audit logging of cross-boundary access

The organization hierarchy implements a sophisticated multi-tenant model with complex permission inheritance, credit flow management, and strict data isolation requirements specific to the marketing agency domain.

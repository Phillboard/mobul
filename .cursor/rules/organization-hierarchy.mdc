# organization-hierarchy

Multi-Tenant Organization Model (Importance: 95/100)

Hierarchical Structure:
- Platform Level (ACE Engage)
- Agency Level (Marketing/Gift Card Resellers) 
- Client Level (End Customers)
- Campaign Level (Individual Gift Card Campaigns)

Core Business Rules:
1. Credit Flow Management
- One-way credit distribution (Platform → Agency → Client)
- Agency-defined markups on gift card denominations
- Client-specific credit pools with campaign allocations
- Automated low balance monitoring and alerts

2. Role-Based Access Control
- Admin: Full platform access
- Tech Support: Cross-organization troubleshooting 
- Agency Owner: Multi-client management
- Company Owner: Single organization access
- Call Center: Redemption-only access
- Developer: API and integration access

3. Permission Inheritance
- Features cascade down organization levels
- Child organizations inherit parent restrictions
- Custom overrides allowed for specific features
- Campaign-level permission aggregation

4. Organization Relationships
- Agencies can manage multiple clients
- Clients belong to single agency
- Support staff can access multiple organization levels
- Campaign ownership tied to client level

5. Client-Agency Hierarchies (Importance: 90/100)
- Agency-defined pricing tiers
- Client-specific gift card brand access
- Shared vs dedicated inventory pools
- Custom denomination configurations

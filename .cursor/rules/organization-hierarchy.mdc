Importance Score: 95

Core Organization Types:
1. Platform Owner - Top-level admin organization
2. Agency - Mid-tier service provider organization
3. Client - End-customer organization
4. Internal - System service organization

Hierarchy Rules:
- Agencies can have multiple clients
- Clients belong to single agency
- Platform owner has visibility across all
- Internal orgs handle system services

Role-Based Access Model:
- platform_admin: Full system access
- agency_owner: Agency + client access
- client_admin: Single client access
- client_user: Limited client access
- internal_service: System operation access

Permission Inheritance:
- Client permissions inherit from agency settings
- Agency configurations cascade to clients
- Role permissions aggregate up hierarchy
- Service account permissions isolated

Organization Relationships:
- Agency-Client: One-to-many mapping
- Platform-Agency: Many-to-many for enterprise
- Client-Internal: Many-to-many for services
- Cross-agency blocks prevent data leaks

Business Unit Modeling:
- Departments within organizations
- Team groupings with leads

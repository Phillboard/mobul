# campaign-condition-model

Core Components:

1. Condition Trigger Engine (90/100)
- Sequential reward condition evaluation with dependency tracking
- Time-based delay support (minutes to days)
- Multi-step verification requirements
- Agent-based manual triggers
- Event-driven automatic triggers (call completion, form submission)

2. Gift Card Distribution Rules (85/100)
- Pool-based allocation with inventory verification
- Real-time balance checking before distribution 
- Provider fallback logic (CSV → API)
- Delivery status tracking through completion
- Failure retry logic with configurable attempts

3. Condition Validation Framework (80/100)
- Pre-publish validation of complete condition chains
- Resource availability verification (gift cards, SMS credits)
- Time window validation for sequential conditions
- Recipient list compatibility checks
- Reward value limit enforcement

4. Reward Delivery Orchestration (75/100)
- Asynchronous reward queuing system
- Delivery method selection (email, SMS, API)
- Status tracking through completion
- Failed delivery handling and retries
- Audit trail maintenance

Key Domain Rules:
1. Conditions must form valid sequential chains
2. Rewards require verified inventory before campaign activation
3. Time delays between conditions must meet minimum/maximum thresholds
4. Manual verification requires specific agent permissions
5. Gift card pools must maintain safety thresholds

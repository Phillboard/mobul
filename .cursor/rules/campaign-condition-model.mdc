# campaign-condition-model

Campaign Condition Management System that handles reward distribution based on configurable triggers and conditions:

Core Components:

1. Condition Evaluation Engine (Importance: 95/100)
- Implements sequential condition verification with dependencies
- Supports condition types:
  * form_submission
  * call_completion 
  * time_delay
  * manual_agent
  * crm_event
- Handles multi-step verification workflows
- Manages condition state transitions
- Integrates with reward distribution system

2. Reward Distribution Logic (Importance: 90/100)
- Automated gift card provisioning based on condition completion
- Supports delayed/scheduled reward distribution
- Implements reward pool management and inventory checks
- Handles multi-condition reward aggregation
- Manages reward delivery status tracking

3. Campaign Integration Layer (Importance: 85/100)
- Links conditions to campaign recipients
- Tracks completion status per recipient
- Manages campaign-level reward budgets
- Handles condition reset/retry workflows

4. Trigger Evaluation System (Importance: 80/100)
- Real-time condition monitoring
- Event-based trigger processing
- Webhook integration for external triggers
- Time-based trigger scheduling

Key Business Rules:
- Conditions must be evaluated in sequence when dependencies exist
- Gift card inventory must be validated before condition activation
- Time-delayed rewards require explicit scheduling
- Manual agent conditions need verification tracking
- CRM events require source validation

Data Models:
- Condition: type, status, dependencies, verification_requirements
- Reward: type, value, delivery_method, scheduled_time
- Trigger: source, event_type, validation_rules
- Distribution: recipient, condition_status, reward_status

# campaign-condition-model

Campaign conditions govern reward distribution through a multi-stage verification system:

Core Condition Types:
1. Manual Agent Verification
- Agent disposition triggers (interested, qualified, appointment) 
- SMS opt-in requirement before reward issuance
- Customizable verification skip rules with audit logging

2. Form Submission
- Lead capture with auto-validation
- Field-level completion requirements
- CRM integration triggers

3. Time-Delayed Rewards 
- Configurable delay periods after qualifying events
- Prerequisite condition dependencies
- Campaign-specific timeout rules

Reward Distribution Logic:
- Hierarchical credit flow: Platform → Agency → Client → Campaign
- Pool-based gift card inventory with brand/denomination mapping
- Automatic Tillo API fallback when CSV inventory depleted
- Real-time balance verification and threshold alerts

Condition State Machine:
```
pending → in_progress → completed/failed
         ↳ expired
         ↳ cancelled
```

Verification Requirements:
- SMS opt-in status validation
- Campaign budget availability check
- Pool inventory verification
- Credit balance confirmation

The model implements complex reward triggers with built-in delays, multi-step verification, and automated fulfillment logic while maintaining strict credit controls and inventory management.

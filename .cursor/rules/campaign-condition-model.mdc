Campaign Condition Model implements the core business logic for reward conditions and distribution:

Primary Business Components:

1. Campaign Condition Engine
- Multi-stage condition evaluation system supporting:
  - form_submission: Requires completed form data
  - call_completed: Validates call center agent verification 
  - immediate: Triggers reward on initial contact
- Configurable time-based delays between stages
- Condition chaining with sequential validation
- Real-time condition monitoring
Importance Score: 95

2. Reward Distribution Rules
- Brand-specific denomination allocation logic
- Pool inventory verification before reward commitment
- Automated balance checking for provisioned cards
- Multi-step reward delivery validation
Importance Score: 90

3. Condition Validation System  
- Campaign-level condition requirements enforcement
- Custom field mapping for form submissions
- Agent verification rule configuration
- Timeout handling for condition stages
Importance Score: 85

Key Domain-Specific Implementations:

1. Complex Condition Chains
- Multiple conditions can be chained sequentially
- Each condition maintains separate verification state
- Configurable delays between condition evaluations
- Automated roll-back on condition failure

2. Distribution Safeguards  
- Pool inventory validation before condition activation
- Real-time balance verification during distribution
- Multi-stage delivery confirmation
- Audit trail of condition evaluations

The condition model represents the core business logic for controlling how and when rewards are distributed within campaigns, with sophisticated rules for verification and delivery.

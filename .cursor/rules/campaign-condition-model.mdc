# campaign-condition-model

## Condition Trigger System (Importance: 90)
- Multiple condition types for reward triggers:
  - Manual agent approval
  - Call completion verification
  - Form submission validation
  - Time-based triggers

## Reward Distribution Logic (Importance: 85)
- Campaign-specific reward validation rules
- Gift card allocation based on condition completion
- Multi-step verification requirements:
  - SMS opt-in status
  - Email verification
  - Call disposition checks

## Condition Chaining (Importance: 80)
- Sequential condition dependencies
- Parallel condition evaluation
- Complex reward routing based on completion status
- Automated trigger evaluation with fail-safes

## Time Delay Management (Importance: 75)
- Configurable delay periods between conditions
- Business hours awareness for trigger evaluation 
- Campaign-specific waiting periods
- Grace period handling for condition completion

## Verification Workflow (Importance: 85)
- Multi-stage approval process
- Role-based verification rules
- Status transition tracking
- Audit trail for condition evaluations

The model emphasizes secure reward distribution through a sophisticated condition evaluation system, with particular focus on verification accuracy and proper sequencing of reward triggers.

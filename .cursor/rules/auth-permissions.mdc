# Authentication and Permissions Architecture

## Core Authorization Design

### Permission Management Strategy

The authentication system implements a sophisticated, granular permission management approach using role-based access control (RBAC).

#### Key Interfaces
```typescript
interface PermissionDefinition {
  resource: string;
  actions: string[];
  conditions?: Record<string, any>;
}

interface UserRole {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  permissions: PermissionDefinition[];
}
```

### Permission Checking Mechanism

#### Permission Gate Component
```typescript
const PermissionGate: React.FC<{
  permission: string;
  resource: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}> = ({ permission, resource, children }) => {
  const { hasPermission } = usePermissions();
  
  if (hasPermission(permission, resource)) {
    return <>{children}</>;
  }
  return null;
};
```

### Authorization Workflow

1. User authenticates
2. Role is determined
3. Permissions are dynamically loaded
4. Per-component permission checks occur

### Advanced Authorization Features

- Conditional permissions
- Dynamic role assignment
- Nested permission hierarchies
- Runtime permission modification

## Security Principles

- Principle of least privilege
- Granular resource-level permissions
- Centralized permission management
- Performance-optimized permission checks

## Implementation Highlights

- TypeScript-powered type safety
- React hooks for permission management
- Flexible permission definition system
- Lightweight runtime permission evaluation

# Gift Card Ecosystem

## Provisioning Architecture

### Core Provisioning Workflow

```typescript
interface GiftCardProvisioningParams {
  amount: number;
  quantity: number;
  expirationDate?: Date;
  tags?: string[];
}

const useGiftCardProvisioning = () => {
  const provisionGiftCards = async (params: GiftCardProvisioningParams) => {
    // Advanced provisioning logic
    const cards = await generateCards(params);
    const billingResult = await processBilling(cards);
    return { cards, billing: billingResult };
  };

  return { provisionGiftCards };
};
```

### Billing Integration

- Supports multiple financial workflows
- Real-time billing calculation
- Comprehensive tracking of financial transactions

### Redemption Tracking

```typescript
interface GiftCardRedemptionRecord {
  cardId: string;
  redeemedAt: Date;
  amountUsed: number;
  remainingBalance: number;
}
```

## Advanced Features

- Programmatic gift card generation
- Flexible denomination support
- Comprehensive tracking mechanisms
- Secure generation algorithms
- Multi-stage billing process

## Security Considerations

- Cryptographically secure code generation
- Immutable redemption records
- Precise balance tracking
- Fraud prevention mechanisms

## Performance Optimizations

- Batch processing of gift card generation
- Efficient database storage strategies
- Minimal overhead in redemption workflows

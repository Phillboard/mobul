# MVP Production Deployment Guide

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Edge Functions (5 minutes)

Deploy the new email functions and updated edge functions:

```bash
cd supabase

# Deploy new email function
npx supabase functions deploy send-gift-card-email

# Deploy updated functions
npx supabase functions deploy provision-gift-card-for-call-center
npx supabase functions deploy send-inventory-alert
npx supabase functions deploy evaluate-conditions
npx supabase functions deploy send-form-notification

# Deploy demo data function (if needed)
npx supabase functions deploy enrich-demo-data
```

### Step 2: Run Database Migration (Automatic)

The email delivery logs migration will run automatically on next deployment:
- `supabase/migrations/20251128000003_email_delivery_logs.sql`

To manually run if needed:
```bash
npx supabase db push
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

#### In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to Project Settings → Edge Functions → Secrets
2. Add the following secrets:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
ALERT_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS=admin@yourdomain.com,ops@yourdomain.com
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
FROM_NAME=Mobul ACE Platform
```

#### To Get Resend API Key:
1. Go to https://resend.com/
2. Sign up for an account (free tier available)
3. Verify your domain (or use their test domain for development)
4. Go to API Keys section
5. Create a new API key
6. Copy the key (starts with `re_`)

### Step 4: Test Email Delivery (10 minutes)

Test the email system:

1. **Test Gift Card Email:**
   - Provision a gift card via call center with email delivery
   - Check email inbox for delivery
   - Verify email formatting and content

2. **Test Form Submission:**
   - Submit an ACE form with email notification enabled
   - Check for confirmation email
   - Verify gift card included if applicable

3. **Test Inventory Alert:**
   - Manually trigger or wait for low inventory
   - Check admin email for alert
   - Verify alert formatting

4. **Check Email Logs:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM email_delivery_logs 
   ORDER BY sent_at DESC 
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

### Step 5: Test Page Navigation (10 minutes)

Test the new gift card pages:

1. **Pool Detail Page:**
   - Navigate to /gift-cards
   - Click on any pool
   - Verify URL: `/gift-cards/pools/:poolId`
   - Test all tabs (Cards, History, Settings)
   - Test Export and Balance Check buttons

2. **Purchase Flow:**
   - Navigate to marketplace
   - Click "Purchase" on a pool
   - Verify URL: `/gift-cards/purchase/:poolId`
   - Complete purchase flow
   - Verify success page

3. **Record Purchase:**
   - Navigate to `/admin/gift-cards/record-purchase`
   - Fill in purchase details
   - Submit and verify success
   - Check purchase history displays

4. **Edit Pricing:**
   - From pool detail page, click "Edit Pricing"
   - Verify URL: `/admin/gift-cards/pools/:poolId/pricing`
   - Update pricing
   - Verify changes saved

### Step 6: Fix Data Issues (5 minutes)

#### Link Campaigns to Audiences:
```sql
UPDATE campaigns c
SET audience_id = (
  SELECT DISTINCT contact_list_id 
  FROM recipients r 
  WHERE r.campaign_id = c.id 
  LIMIT 1
)
WHERE audience_id IS NULL;
```

#### Populate Gift Card Pools:
- Navigate to /admin/data-simulation
- Use "Generate Demo Data" feature
- Or upload cards manually via CSV

### Step 7: Run MVP Verification (5 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to /admin/mvp-verification
# Run all system checks
# Export verification report
# Address any failing checks
```

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending
1. Check `RESEND_API_KEY` is set correctly

3. Check email logs: `SELECT * FROM email_delivery_logs WHERE delivery_status = 'failed'`
4. Check edge function logs in Supabase dashboard

### Navigation Not Working
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify routes are added to App.tsx
4. Check lazy imports are correct

### Data Issues
1. Run campaign-audience linking SQL
2. Generate demo data via `/admin/data-simulation`
3. Check database constraints aren't blocking inserts

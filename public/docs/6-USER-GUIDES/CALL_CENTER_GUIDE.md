## Call Handling Workflow

### Step 1: Answer the Call

**Greeting Script Example:**
> "Thank you for calling [Company Name], this is [Your Name]. May I have your confirmation code please?"

### Step 2: Look Up the Recipient

1. Enter the caller's **8-character code** in the search field
2. Press Enter or click **Search**
3. The recipient's information will appear:
   - Name
   - Campaign name
   - Mailing address
   - Gift card eligibility

**If code not found:**
- Ask caller to repeat the code slowly
- Check for common mistakes: O vs 0, I vs 1
- Verify the campaign is still active

### Step 3: Verify Caller Identity

Before processing any rewards, verify the caller:

**Verification Questions:**
- "May I have the first and last name on your mailer?"
- "Can you confirm the address where you received this?"
- "What city and state are you calling from?"

**Match at least 2 of 3:**
- Name on file
- Mailing address
- Phone number (caller ID)

### Step 4: Collect or Confirm Information

**For SMS delivery, confirm:**
- "What's the best phone number to send your gift card to?"
- "I'm showing [phone number], is that correct?"

**For Email delivery, confirm:**
- "What email address should I send your gift card to?"
- "Can you spell that for me?"

### Step 5: Select Campaign Condition

1. Review the campaign conditions shown on screen
2. Ask qualifying questions if needed
3. Select the condition the caller meets:
   - "Call Completed" - Default for phone inquiries
   - "Appointment Scheduled" - If booking is required
   - "Quote Requested" - If collecting estimate details

### Step 6: Process the Gift Card

1. Confirm delivery method (SMS or Email)
2. Verify contact information is correct
3. Click **Confirm Redemption**
4. Wait for confirmation message

**Tell the caller:**
> "I've sent your [Amount] [Brand] gift card to [phone/email]. You should receive it within a few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with?"

### Step 7: Provide Redemption Instructions

**For digital gift cards:**
> "You'll receive a text message with your gift card code. You can use it online at [brand].com or show the code at any [brand] store."

**Common redemption help:**
- Amazon: Add to Amazon account balance at amazon.com/redeem
- Visa: Use like a credit card online or in-store
- Starbucks: Add to Starbucks app or show at store

## Handling Common Situations

### Code Not Found

**Possible causes:**

- Code from inactive campaign
- Typing error

**Steps:**
1. Ask caller to spell the code letter by letter
2. Check for common confusions (O/0, I/1/L)
3. Ask for the sender/company name on the mailer
4. Search by phone number if available
5. If still not found, apologize and escalate

**Script:**
> "I apologize, but I'm not finding that code in our system. Let me have you spell it out for me one more time..."

### No Gift Cards Available

**If inventory is depleted:**
1. Apologize to the caller
2. Take their information
3. Promise follow-up within 24 hours
4. Alert your supervisor immediately

**Script:**
> "I apologize, but we're temporarily out of that gift card. I'd like to take your information and make sure you receive it within 24 hours. Is that okay?"

### Caller Already Redeemed

**If the code shows already used:**
1. Check the redemption date and details
2. Explain the card was already sent
3. Offer to resend if delivery failed

**Script:**
> "I'm showing that your gift card was already sent on [date] to [phone/email]. Would you like me to resend it?"

### Caller Can't Find Their Code

**Help them locate it:**
- "The code should be on the mailer you received, usually near the QR code"
- "It's an 8-character code with letters and numbers"
- "Check the back of the postcard near the bottom"

### Caller Has Technical Issues

**For redemption problems:**
1. Ask what error they're seeing
2. Verify the card code is correct
3. Suggest trying a different browser
4. Offer to contact the brand on their behalf
5. Escalate to supervisor if unresolved
